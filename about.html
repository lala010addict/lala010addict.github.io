I am a full stack software engineer with a strong background in JavaScript. My experience includes working with technologies such React, Ember, AngularJS, and Ionic on the frontend, as well as Node.js/Express, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, RethinkDB, MongoDB, REST APIs, and MySQL on the backend. 

I have a passion for building data structures and algorithms to solve new and interesting problems. I love to tackle challenging problems together with other talented and creative engineers.
